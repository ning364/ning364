Binary Search: How sceanrio could use binary Search.

This is a summary of Leetcode Stucy in which sceaniro could use binary search algorithem. This is only my experience.

Using Binary search, the array must be sorted.

First Sceanrio. To find a Target in array:  
        Example:
        int find(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
            int left = 0, right = nums.size();
            while (left < right) {
                int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;   // To avoid mid value not overflowed.
                if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
                else if (nums[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
                else right = mid;
            }
        return -1;
        }
